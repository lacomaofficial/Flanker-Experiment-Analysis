# Flanker-Experiment-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes reaction times in a neuroscience/psychology flanker experiment. Participants were tasked with identifying the direction of a center arrow while being influenced by flanking arrows (congruent and incongruent conditions). The analysis aims to understand if slower reaction times are caused by visual confusion and cognitive interference.

## Key Features
- Exploring and visualizing the distribution of reaction times for different flanker conditions.
- Conducting statistical tests (t-test) to compare mean reaction times between conditions.
- Interactive visualizations for easy data exploration.
